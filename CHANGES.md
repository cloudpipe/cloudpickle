- Fix a bug affecting dynamic modules occuring with modified builtins
  ([issue #316](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/316))

- Fix a bug affecting cloudpickle when non-modules objects are added into
  sys.modules
  ([PR #326](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/326)).
  
- Fix a regression in cloudpickle and python3.8 causing an error when trying to

  ([PR #329](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/329)).

- Fix a bug when a thread imports a module while cloudpickle iterates
  over the module list
  ([PR #322](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/322)).

1.2.2
=====

- Revert the change introduced in
  ([issue #276](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/276))
  attempting to pickle functions annotations for Python 3.4 to 3.6. It is not
  possible to pickle complex typing constructs for those versions (see
  [issue #193]( https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/193))

- Fix a bug affecting bound classmethod saving on Python 2.
  ([issue #288](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/288))

- Add support for pickling "getset" descriptors
  ([issue #290](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/290))

1.2.1
=====

- Restore (partial) support for Python 3.4 for downstream projects that have
  LTS versions that would benefit from cloudpickle bug fixes.


1.2.0
=====

- Leverage the C-accelerated Pickler new subclassing API (available in Python
  3.8) in cloudpickle. This allows cloudpickle to pickle Python objects up to
  30 times faster.
  ([issue #253](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/253))

- Support pickling of classmethod and staticmethod objects in python2.
  arguments. ([issue #262](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/262))

- Add support to pickle type annotations for Python 3.5 and 3.6 (pickling type
  annotations was already supported for Python 3.7, Python 3.4 might also work
  but is no longer officially supported by cloudpickle)
  ([issue #276](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/276))

- Internal refactoring to proactively detect dynamic functions and classes when
  pickling them.  This refactoring also yields small performance improvements
  when pickling dynamic classes (~10%)
  ([issue #273](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/273))

1.1.1
=====

- Minor release to fix a packaging issue (Markdown formatting of the long
  description rendered on pypi.org). The code itself is the same as 1.1.0.

1.1.0
=====

- Support the pickling of interactively-defined functions with positional-only
  arguments. ([issue #266](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/266))

- Track the provenance of dynamic classes and enums so as to preseve the
  usual `isinstance` relationship between pickled objects and their
  original class defintions.
  ([issue #246](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/246))

1.0.0
=====

- Fix a bug making functions with keyword-only arguments forget the default
  values of these arguments after being pickled.
  ([issue #264](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/264))

0.8.1
=====

- Fix a bug (already present before 0.5.3 and re-introduced in 0.8.0)
  affecting relative import instructions inside depickled functions
  ([issue #254](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/254))

0.8.0
=====

- Add support for pickling interactively defined dataclasses.
  ([issue #245](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/245))

- Global variables referenced by functions pickled by cloudpickle are now
  unpickled in a new and isolated namespace scoped by the CloudPickler
  instance. This restores the (previously untested) behavior of cloudpickle
  prior to changes done in 0.5.4 for functions defined in the `__main__`
  module, and 0.6.0/1 for other dynamic functions.

0.7.0
=====

- Correctly serialize dynamically defined classes that have a `__slots__`
  attribute.
  ([issue #225](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/225))


0.6.1
=====

- Fix regression in 0.6.0 which breaks the pickling of local function defined
  in a module, making it impossible to access builtins.
  ([issue #211](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/211))


0.6.0
=====

- Ensure that unpickling a function defined in a dynamic module several times
  sequentially does not reset the values of global variables.
  ([issue #187](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/205))

- Restrict the ability to pickle annotations to python3.7+ ([issue #193](
  https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/193) and [issue #196](
  https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/196))

- Stop using the deprecated `imp` module under Python 3.
  ([issue #207](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/207))

- Fixed pickling issue with singleton types `NoneType`, `type(...)` and
  `type(NotImplemented)` ([issue #209](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/209))


0.5.6
=====

- Ensure that unpickling a locally defined function that accesses the global
  variables of a module does not reset the values of the global variables if
  they are already initialized.
  ([issue #187](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/187))


0.5.5
=====

- Fixed inconsistent version in `cloudpickle.__version__`.


0.5.4
=====

- Fixed a pickling issue for ABC in python3.7+ ([issue #180](
  https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/180)).

  variables ([issue #187](
  https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/187)).

0.5.3
=====
- Fixed a crash in Python 2 when serializing non-hashable instancemethods of built-in
  types ([issue #144](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/144)).

- itertools objects can also pickled
  ([PR #156](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/156)).

- `logging.RootLogger` can be also pickled
  ([PR #160](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/160)).

0.5.2
=====

- Fixed a regression: `AttributeError` when loading pickles that hold a
  reference to a dynamically defined class from the `__main__` module.
  ([issue #131]( https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/131)).

- Make it possible to pickle classes and functions defined in faulty
  modules that raise an exception when trying to look-up their attributes
  by name.


0.5.1
=====

- Fixed `cloudpickle.__version__`.

0.5.0
=====

- Use `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` by default.

0.4.4
=====

- `logging.RootLogger` can be also pickled
  ([PR #160](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/160)).

0.4.3
=====

- Fixed a regression: `AttributeError` when loading pickles that hold a
  reference to a dynamically defined class from the `__main__` module.
  ([issue #131]( https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/131)).

- Fixed a crash in Python 2 when serializing non-hashable instancemethods of built-in
  types. ([issue #144](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/144))

0.4.2
=====

- Restored compatibility with pickles from 0.4.0.
- Handle the `func.__qualname__` attribute.

0.4.1
=====

- Fixed a crash when pickling dynamic classes whose `__dict__` attribute was
  defined as a [`property`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property).
  Most notably, this affected dynamic [namedtuples](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#namedtuple-factory-function-for-tuples-with-named-fields)
  in Python 2. (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/113)
- Cloudpickle now preserves the `__module__` attribute of functions (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/118/).
- Fixed a crash when pickling modules that don't have a `__package__` attribute (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/116).

=====

* Fix functions with empty cells
* Allow pickling Logger objects
* Fix crash when pickling dynamic class cycles
