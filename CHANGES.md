0.5.2
=====

- Fixed a regression: `AttributeError` when loading pickles that hold a
  reference to a dynamically defined class from the `__main__` module.
  ([issue #131]( https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/131)).


0.5.1
=====

- Fixed `cloudpickle.__version__`.

0.5.0
=====

- Use `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` by default.

0.4.2
=====

- Restored compatibility with pickles from 0.4.0.
- Handle the `func.__qualname__` attribute.

0.4.1
=====

- Fixed a crash when pickling dynamic classes whose `__dict__` attribute was
  defined as a [`property`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property).
  Most notably, this affected dynamic [namedtuples](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#namedtuple-factory-function-for-tuples-with-named-fields)
  in Python 2. (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/113)
- Cloudpickle now preserves the `__module__` attribute of functions (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/118/).
- Fixed a crash when pickling modules that don't have a `__package__` attribute (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/116).
